## Basics of Github actions in the workflow

  1. Use a build matrix if you want your workflow to run tests across multiple combinations of operating systems, platforms, and languages. 
  3. Use of matrix to run the workflow for different environments or even you can set different variables as per the environment if needed
  4. Connect to AWS account using Github secrets
  6. Use of `workflow-dispatch` to trigger the workflow manually
  7. Use of `max-parallel` to run the job for both the environments in parallel
  8. Set working directory to any of your subfolder
  9. Use of Environments in the workflow to approve the changes for higher environments if needed.



## Deploy only when push to main branch (deploy.yaml)

We will be applying the changes only when there is a push in the main branch.
